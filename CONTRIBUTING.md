# Contributing to Short-Research-Agent

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Short-Research-Agent** project!  
This repository focuses on building an AI-powered research assistant that helps automate short research tasks like topic summarization, citation finding, and data extraction. Your contributions — from documentation improvements to new features — are extremely valuable!



## 🚀 How You Can Contribute

### 📌 Features & Enhancements
- Add new research capabilities (e.g., improved topic summarization, keyword extraction, context awareness).
- Integrate additional NLP or embedding models (e.g., BERT, GPT embeddings, semantic search).
- Improve performance and accuracy (fine-tuning, caching results, optimizing inference time).

### 🧠 Model Improvements
- Experiment with different large language models or retrieval techniques.
- Improve prompt design for better results.
- Add evaluation scripts to assess accuracy or relevance.

### 🧰 Infrastructure & Tools
- Create modular scripts for easier reuse (e.g., research API, notebook pipelines).
- Add Docker support or environment setup scripts.
- Provide deployment options (Flask, FastAPI, serverless functions).

### 📚 Documentation & Tutorials
- Improve the README with clear instructions.
- Add example notebooks for researchers or developers.
- Create tutorials on how to run or extend the agent.

### 📊 Visualization & Results
- Add graphs, performance metrics, or result views.
- Provide a UI/frontend demo to interact with the model.
